# SQL and Relational Databases
<strong>Overview: </strong>Work with the posts and related data from the StackOverflow site for questions about statistics cross-validated the Stats.stackexchange forum.

The database has 14 tables: 8 have information regarding posts, users, tags, etc., and 6 provide meta-data (text descriptions of different types). Documentation for each of the tables is available
at [Schema for StackOverflow Databases](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede).

I will be working with RSQLite and DBI R packages.
